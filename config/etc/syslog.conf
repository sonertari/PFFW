# Uncomment to log to a central host named "loghost".  You need to run
# syslogd with the -u option on the remote host if you are using this.
# (This is also required to log info from things like routers and
# ISDN-equipment).  If you run -u, you are vulnerable to syslog bombing,
# and should consider blocking external syslog packets.
